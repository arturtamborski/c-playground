# c-playground
Bunch of useless programs written mostly in C.

The best things in this repo are the Makefiles.

There are three versions of them:
  - `Makefile.0` contains empty rule stub
  - `Makefile.1` contains rules for simple main.c programs
  - `Makefile.2` contains rules for more advanced programs with multiple source files
  - `Makefile.3` contains rules for even more complicated programs with shared libs and multiple source files

Each project links to one of those Makefiles. There's also a root Makefile that just builds every project in this repo.
